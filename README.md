## Description

My motivation for this project was the desire to have a dedicated place for notes that was easy to access. I built this project to fulfill that need. This project solves the issues of easily lost notes, whether it be a file on the computer, or loose papers. A website is just one link away. In building this project I learn about a plethora of things. This includes, but is not limited to: Git commands, HTML coding, CSS coding, and JavaScript coding.
